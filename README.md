My solution to the set of homeworks for the 2013-2014 "Programming Fundamentals" class, held by prof. Fabio Pellacini.
Each homework specifies 3 programming assignments. The text of the assignment is specified at the top of each file and the difficulty ranges from basic array manipulations to graph algorithms, image manipulations and a simple tetris game development.
